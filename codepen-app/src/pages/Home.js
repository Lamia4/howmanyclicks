                    CodePen is a social development environment. At its heart, it allows
                    you to write code in the browser, and see the results of it as you
                    build. A useful and liberating online code editor for developers of
                    any skill, and particularly empowering for people learning to code. We
                    focus primarily on front-end languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                    preprocessing syntaxes that turn into those things.
